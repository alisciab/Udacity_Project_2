# Investigate a Dataset
## by Aliscia Boyd


## Dataset: Movie Data from TheMovieDataBase.com

> For this project I chose to analyze the TMDb (The Movie Database) dataset. I analyzed this dataset to answer the following questions:

   > 1. Which genre was the most produced each year? 

   > 2. Is there any correlation between a movie's budget and it's popularity?
    
   > 3. Which genre has the higher average popularity, Horror or Action?
   
   > 4. When compared to the highest rated movie, do most movies tend to have higher or lower vote averages?
   
   > 5. Which genre had the highest total popularity each year?


## Summary of Findings

Analysis of this dataset yielded the effects that certain characteristics of a movie (genre, rating, budget) can have on its popularity.

> Movies within the Comedy genre tend to have been the most popular over the last 20 years, with Comedy being the most popular genre in 7 different years. Horror, Family, and Thriller movies tend to have been the least popular, winning most popular genre in only 1 year each.

> There is no discernable relationship between the amount spent making a movie and it's popularity.

> On average, Action movies have been much more popular than Horror movies over the twenty year period covered by this dataset.
